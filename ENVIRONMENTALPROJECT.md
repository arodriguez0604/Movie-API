So another idea I had for our app was an environment-based app that allows users to customize their lifestyle in order to live more sustainably.

This idea is sort of based off of two apps that already exist, called Green Me! and Joule Bug. Green Me! basically provides users with a number of ways in which they can be more environmentally responsible. For example, the app has a section called "Green My Clothing", which gives users unique ideas on how to reuse, refurnish, or donate old clothes. It also provides users with nearby donation sites and stuff.

The second app, Joule Bug, basically allows the user to input their current electrical, heating, and other energy logistics in the app, and then calculates how much total energy they use. The app then provides users with ways to conserve energy by computing the total wattage the person is using, how much their energy costs. The app also has a feature that tracks your energy usage, and rewards you with badges and stuff as you start to save more energy. You can also connect the app to facebook or instagram to see your ranking compared to users.

So essentially I was thinking we could make an app that almost combines the main functionalities of these exisiting app, but make it better and more intuitive to use. This app solves a legitimate problem about the environment and I think would be a good idea.

Yes, it is a good idea to save all of our files on Google Drive.

 Good idea but I'm assuming we would need scientific facts/research to do this
