# Movie-API

FiLES WILL BE STORED ON GOOGLE DRIVE

POSSIBLE IDEA: App that takes data from movie database (themoviedb or imdb) and uses the information to give reccomendations
on the users past ratings. It figures out the genres/directors you like along with other possible preferences and compares
with other users who have the same taste

There is already a website like this, however, called criticker.com. It uses this formula

percentile = floor((num_lower + (num_matching / 2) / total_ratings) * 100)
79 = floor((195 + (10/2) / 251) * 100)

so we don't know if we are going to go with it or not. Supposedly we can make a better version of it, or hope nobody knows the
the website; it's not exactly mainstream. We can also add a diary feature, where you can "log" movies on the date you've watched them
and follow other people like social media. It would essentially be a cross between Letterboxd and Criticker.

The original idea was to have an browser extension that blocks out spoilers by searching the text for the title of movie/tv shows
along with the characters in it. You can mark which ones you've watched and which ones you don't want spoiled. This can be intergrated
with the previous idea.
